"""
This program simulates the model using the cleaned ACS data and parameter
estimates derived by the estimation files (2 & 3). It proceeds in multiple steps:

1. Simulate the leave type that is taken by each individual
2. Simulate the required probabilities for each binary decision
3. Simulate the binary decisions based on probabilities in step 2

To do:
- create the lnlength variable needed for input to
- simulate the decisions based on the binary probabilities
- figure out how to do this for multiple leaves
